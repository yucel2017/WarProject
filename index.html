          AND REPOSES CONFIDENCE IN THEM, THE ARMY WILL BE UNITED IN MIND AND
          ALL WILL BE HAPPY TO SERVE THEIR LEADERS.” ―SUN TZU

        <h1>THE GREATEST MILITARY STRATEGIST</h1>
        <p>
          The oldest available sources disagree as to where Sun Tzu was born.
          The Spring and Autumn Annals and Sima Qian's later Records of the
          Grand Historian (Shiji) state that Sun Tzu was born in Qi. Both
          sources also agree that Sun Tzu was born in the late Spring and Autumn
          period and that he was active as a general and strategist, serving
          King Helü of Wu in the late sixth century BC, beginning around 512 BC.
          Sun Tzu's victories then inspired him to write The Art of War. The Art
          of War was one of the most widely read military treatises in the
          subsequent Warring States period, a time of constant war among seven
          ancient Chinese states–Zhao, Qi, Qin, Chu, Han, Wei, and Yan–who
          fought to control the vast expanse of fertile territory in
          <span>Eastern China.</span>

            Sun Tzu says that it is better not to fight than to be involved in a
